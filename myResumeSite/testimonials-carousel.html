She is intelligent, extremely knowledgeable in her field, and very professional. Not only does she create user documentation, including how-to guides and instruction manuals, she is also an exceptional researcher.   Ms. Sivenkova has an EXCELLENT ability to convey complex information in an appropriate fashion to audiences with different levels of technical knowledge.   She is able to work under tight deadlines and respond to changing business and technical conditions.  In my view, she is one of the top Technical Writers in Berlin.  My experience of working with her has certainly lived up to the impeccable reputation that she has developed over the years. VERY highly recommended.</p>

Her commitment and motivation to excel at everything she does are incredible, and combined with her intelligence and a very friendly personality, that makes her an absolute asset. She is extremely knowledgeable in her field and constantly expanding her expertise. Not only is she a brilliant researcher, but also a talented lecturer and teacher; she was always very good at finding new creative ways of delivering material to students, organizing her lectures, and approaching problems overall. 
 Her work habits are outstanding. She is self-motivated, highly organized and responsible. Her communication skills, both verbal and written, are excellent. It was a true honor and pleasure to work with her, and I cannot recommend her enough.</p>

                                            <p>Maria is an experienced technical writer with a track record of producing high quality technical documentation. Our documentation system is rather complex, involves several types of deliverables, and demands high flexibility, commitment, and stamina on the part of the technical writer, with substantial workloads coming during major releases. And Maria copes just fine! I like her versatility and especially value her contribution with writing our API documentation and the in-app copy, such as error messages. Among her strengths I would mention the use of a VCS and docs-as-code workflows. In general, this writer has a passion for communicating highly complex technical concepts clearly and concisely. I hope that she continues working for us and wish her much success as a freelance writer.</p>

She is excellent in proofreading English in technical documentation such as User Manuals, Reference Manuals, and Application Examples. Importantly, she could process in source very different types of our documentation: Adobe FrameMaker, LaTeX, XML, Jupyter Notebooks (Markdown), RST. Our projects deal with complex technical content (mathematics and physics) that contains equations, mutual cross-references, and specific terminology in several different physics directions - and Maria always handled these difficult tasks successfully and professionally. I can highly recommend her as a Technical Writer. She is a valuable asset to our team!</p>

                                            <p>I know Maria Sivenkova as a successful academic writer and author of several university-level courses and textbooks on linguistic pragmatics, organisational communication, and ESP. She conducted several university courses, supervised graduate and postgraduate research projects, and wrote several influential articles and book chapters on linguistic pragmatics. 
I am also impressed by her skills as a videographer, completing challenging projects from conception to fruition in no time. I like her commitment and absolute reliability and wish her huge success as a freelance writer and videographer.  </p>

Her expert knowledge in writing technical documentation allowed us to deliver high quality user manuals to the client. She was able to play many roles at the same time being a translator, technical writer and a lead of the team responsible for creating user manuals. I remembered Maria as a very energetic person with great personality. She has managed to build strong relationships with the customers and with the team members. Everyone enjoyed working with Maria.</p>
